## [~] $ whoami

I'm Omar Valdez.

My purpose is to share my knowledge with the community interested in the fascinating world of data, and my goal is to cover the entire ecosystem of the data lifecycle, from architecture to analysis.

Through tutorials, practical tips, personal reflections, and case studies, this place will be a valuable resource for all data enthusiasts, whether for a curious beginner or an expert in search of new perspectives.

- I've worn many hats in the data universe: Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Sciencist, Data Engineer, and Data Architect.
- One of my primary goals is to make the complex world of data accessible to everyone interested in this topic.
- Data should empower, not intimidate, and I'm here to bridge that gap.

### Avatar

You might be wondering about my avatar. Basically it's a metaphorical representation of my approach to data:

- Pixelated: Just as pixels are the building blocks of a digital image, raw data forms the foundation of our digital landscape. Technically, it's the unrefined, unprocesed information waiting to be transformed.
- Plumber: Like a plumber who works to fix and mantain plumbing systems of a building, my thinking is to dive deep into the data pipelines, unclogging bottlenecks, and ensuring the data flow.
- Game-like aesthetic: Just as games encourage exploration, creativity, and problem solving, I approach data with a sense of curiosity and a desire to make it accessible and engaging for all.
