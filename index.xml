      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Omar Valdez.
My purpose is to share my knowledge with the community interested in the fascinating world of data, and my goal is to encompass the entire data lifecycle ecosystem, from generation to deployment. Additionally, I want to highlight the key elements that underlie the data lifecycle, such as security, data management, DataOps (data operations), data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.
What I will NOT talk about:
I will not focus on general topics.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt overwhelmed by terms like Data Lake, metadata, or Data Governance, then you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place. I know that even for the same concept, there can be different interpretations, so my intention is not to define but to explain the word in a simple way, accompanied by an example or context.
If you think something should be added or edited, you can leave a comment at the end of this post, or you can also contact me in whichever way is most convenient for you.</description>
