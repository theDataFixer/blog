One of my primary goals is to make the complex world of data accessible to everyone interested in this topic. Data should empower, not intimidate, and I\u0026rsquo;m here to bridge that gap. Avatar You might be wondering about my avatar. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s a metaphorical representation of my approach to data:\nPixelated: Just as pixels are the building blocks of a digital image, raw data forms the foundation of our digital landscape. Technically, it\u0026rsquo;s the unrefined, unprocesed information waiting to be transformed. Plumber: Like a plumber who works to fix and mantain plumbing systems of a building, my thinking is to dive deep into the data pipelines, unclogging bottlenecks, and ensuring the data flow. Game-like aesthetic: Just as games encourage exploration, creativity, and problem solving, I approach data with a sense of curiosity and a desire to make it accessible and engaging for all.
